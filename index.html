      <p>I may be the first ever self-stylized "Pink Hat Hacker". I'm fascinated by
        the ins and outs of the web-based global community. But, rather than choosing
        "white hat" or "black hat", I chose to create "Pink Hat" because I am driven
        to make the world a better place - much like the color pink does for me.</p>
      <p>It is my ambition to ultimately design programs, applications, and connections
        broadly for non-profits, and most specifically for animal welfare organizations,
        sanctuaries, and shelters. But first things first: I have skills to hone and
        develop, and these I offer to you. I am ready to dive in head-first, adapt quickly, 
        and take charge.</p>
      <p>I am an honors graduate of Louisiana State University, Class of 2009. I earned
        a Bachelor of arts in Anthropology and Women & Gender Studies. Coupled with over
        15 years of retail experience and management, I have a deep understanding of what
        makes people tick. I also have a well-developed capacity for leadership, initiative,
        and communication.</p>
      <p>I have also spend several years in various office-based positions learning to
        manipulate any and all equipment and software, from a multi-line phone system,
        to a complex electronic health records platform. I am no stranger to perserverance.
        A native of southeastern Louisiana, I am a Katrina survivor. I have been laid offer
        due to economic fluctuations more than once. I have moved myself in a car across 
        the country twice - to Seattle, Wa and back to Atlanta, GA with my black cat and
        daughter in-tow.</p>
      <p>I plan to make my permanent home back in Seattle within the next five years. I can
        certainly make the trek again - I know the way. I will achieve my dream of making
        the world a better place one terrabyte at a time. Grab your Pink Hat and follow me!</p>
